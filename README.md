# genetargeter

Creates a construct developed by the Niles Lab at MIT, designed to deliver a 3' UTR post-transcriptional regulatory element payload to a specific given gene in Plasmodium falciparum.

Future plans include custom plasmids, automatic gRNA selection, and generalization to inserting elements into any chromosomal DNA sequence of any sequenced eukaryote.
