 **** Message log for PF3D7_0105700_asparagine-rich_antigen_Pfa35-2-targeting construct based on plasmid pSN054_V5 **** 

Choosing gRNA with PAM sequence TTTV for use with enzyme Cpf1
Warning: no acceptable gRNA with at least 30.0% GC content, 20.0 on-target score, 75.0 off-target total score, no 4-homopolymer sequences, and no TTT sequences found on gene PF3D7_0105700_asparagine-rich_antigen_Pfa35-2.
Will use backup gRNA with highest GC content, if there are any backups.
0 backup gRNAs with possible off-target effects annotated.


ERROR: no gRNAs found. Please modify your criteria or select and annotate one manually.
